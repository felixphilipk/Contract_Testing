# Smart Contract Audit Report for 0x9Bd2177027edEE300DC9F1fb88F24DB6e5e1edC6

## Overview
- **Contract Address**: [0x9Bd2177027edEE300DC9F1fb88F24DB6e5e1edC6](https://etherscan.io/address/0x9Bd2177027edEE300DC9F1fb88F24DB6e5e1edC6)
- **Audited Functions**: `transfer()`.

## Issues Identified

### Issue 1: [High]
**Description:** 
Some tokens do not revert the transaction when the transfer or transferFrom fails and returns False. Hence we must check the return value after calling the transfer or transferFrom function.

**Proof of Concept:** 
The contract uses OpenZeppelin's ERC20 implementation which doesn't revert on failure for transfer or transferFrom by default

**Recommended Mitigation:**
- The SafeERC20 library from OpenZeppelin already provides methods like safeTransfer and safeTransferFrom which revert if the transfer fails.
- If the contract is meant to be used in an environment where you can't modify the external calls, you might consider overriding the transfer and transferFrom functions in your version of the ERC20 token to include the revert logic.


## Additional Notes

- **Gas Optimizations**: 
  - Plus equals (+=) costs more gas than addition operator. The same thing happens with minus equals (-=)
  -	The require() and revert() functions take an input string to show errors if the validation fails.
    This strings inside these functions that are longer than 32 bytes require at least one additional MSTORE, along with additional overhead for computing memory offset, and other parameters.
  - Public constant variables cost more gas because the EVM automatically creates getter functions for them and adds    entries to the method ID table. The values can be read from the source code instead.  


## Conclusion

The audit for smart contract `0x9Bd2177027edEE300DC9F1fb88F24DB6e5e1edC6` identified a critical issue with token transfer operations not reverting on failure, which could lead to security risks. Employing the `SafeERC20` library or modifying existing transfer functions to include revert logic is highly recommended. The report also notes opportunities for gas optimization to enhance efficiency. Addressing these issues will significantly improve the contract's security and performance, ensuring stakeholder trust and transaction integrity.
