# Smart Contract Audit Report for 0xf93E0edc76f3147C63F53E7eD245330b96009B26

## Overview
- **Contract Address**: [0x](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf93E0edc76f3147C63F53E7eD245330b96009B26)
- **Audited Functions**: `transfer()`, `allowance`.

## Issues Identified

### Issue 1: [High]
**Description:** 
Some tokens do not revert the transaction when the transfer or transferFrom fails and returns False. Hence we must check the return value after calling the transfer or transferFrom function.

**Proof of Concept:** 
To address the issue where some tokens do not revert the transaction when transfer or transferFrom fails and merely returns false, you need to ensure that your smart contract checks the return value of these functions.

**Recommended Mitigation:**
- Instead of relying on transfer or transferFrom directly, use safeTransfer or safeTransferFrom from the SafeERC20 library when dealing with ERC20 transfers in future implementations or within these functions if you're directly handling token transfers.


### Issue 2: [High]
**Description:** 
Vulnerabilities in the traditional approve function of ERC20 tokens, which does not handle the allowance atomically. This vulnerability can lead to front-running attacks where an attacker can exploit the timing between approval transactions

**Proof of Concept:** 
The standard approve function sets or resets the allowance for a spender. If a user wants to change an existing allowance from X to Y where Y < X, an attacker can intercept this transaction and use the old allowance before it's updated

**Recommended Mitigation:**
- Use increaseAllowance and decreaseAllowance: Instead of using approve directly, implement or use functions that allow for atomic changes to the allowance. These functions will adjust the current allowance rather than setting it outright, which prevents the front-running attack.



## Additional Notes

- **Gas Optimizations**: 
- The contract was found to be using revert() statements. Since Solidity v0.8.4, custom errors have been introduced    which are a better alternative to the revert.This allows the developers to pass custom errors with dynamic data while reverting the transaction and also making the whole implementation a bit cheaper than using revert.
- The contract was found to be doing comparisons using inequalities inside the if statement.
When inside the if statements, non-strict inequalities (>=, <=) are usually cheaper than the strict equalities (>, <).
- The contract was found to be performing comparisons using inequalities inside the require statement. When inside the require statements, non-strict inequalities (>=, <=) are usually costlier than strict equalities (>, <).
- Public constant variables cost more gas because the EVM automatically creates getter functions for them and adds entries to the method ID table. The values can be read from the source code instead.
- Plus equals (+=) costs more gas than addition operator. The same thing happens with minus equals (-=)
- The require() and revert() functions take an input string to show errors if the validation fails.
This strings inside these functions that are longer than 32 bytes require at least one additional MSTORE, along with additional overhead for computing memory offset, and other parameters.
