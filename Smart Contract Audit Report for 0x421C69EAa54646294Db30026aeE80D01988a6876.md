# Smart Contract Audit Report for 0x421C69EAa54646294Db30026aeE80D01988a6876

## Overview
- **Contract Address**: [0x421C69EAa54646294Db30026aeE80D01988a6876](https://etherscan.io/address/0x421C69EAa54646294Db30026aeE80D01988a6876)
- **Audited Functions**: `transfer()`, `authorizeUpgrade()`.

## Issues Identified

### Issue 1: [Critical]
**Description:** 
The smart contract in question utilizes the UUPSUpgradeable pattern but lacks proper authorization for the _authorizeUpgrade function. This function is crucial for securing the upgradeToAndCall method, which controls contract upgrades. In its current state, the _authorizeUpgrade function is virtual and must be overridden to implement security measures that restrict access to authorized addresses or roles. Without these restrictions, any entity can potentially call upgradeToAndCall, leading to unauthorized upgrades and compromising the contract's integrity and security.

**Proof of Concept:** 
Without an override that implements access control, anyone could potentially call upgradeTo or upgradeToAndCall, leading to unauthorized upgrades which is a significant security concern.

**Recommended Mitigation:**
- The contract lacks an implementation of _authorizeUpgrade, which, if not properly implemented in a child contract or elsewhere, poses a security risk as described
- incorporate more complex access control logic like role-based access control. If this contract is meant to be used with another contract where the override is implemented, then that contract would need to be reviewed for proper authorization mechanisms

### Issue 2: [Critical]
**Description:** 
The smart contract is accepting Ether at its address. This ether can be stored but due to misconfigurations or missing functions, there is no way to transfer this Ether out of the contract's address. This causes the Ether to be locked inside the contract.

**Proof of Concept:** 
If the logic for managing Ether (like withdrawal) isn't implemented in the contract pointed to by _implementation(), then indeed, the Ether would be locked in the proxy contract.

**Recommended Mitigation:**
- Ensure that the implementation contract has functions to either:Send Ether out when certain conditions are met, or    Allow for an upgrade where such functionality is added.
- implement a direct withdrawal function in the proxy itself if that's the design intent, but this is less common in upgradeable proxy patterns.
